Description

The year is 1985. Your job is to build a text-based (console) RPG game.
The point of this exercise is to better master Javascript functions, loops, conditionals, and some data types.

**Project Requirements:** 

1. Console must greet player with a fun message -- "Greetings traveler, you are about to embark on a journey of a lifetime, to collect knowledge from the greatest gurus around the world. It will take stamina, patience, and willingness to learn, but first...tell me your name?"
2. Console must ask for the player's name and store it -- "Pleasure to know your name ___ , although I am sure you will recieve many more along your way. Are you ready to begin?"
3. Walking:
- The console will ask the user to enter a "w" to walk
- Every time the player walks, a random algorithm will be run that determines if a Guru has appeared (A 1/3 or 1/4 chance of encounter)
- Use a while loop to control this flow.
1. If a guru appears:
- The guru is random (can be chosen out of a minimum of 3 different Guru names)
- The user can decide to learn or return home
- If learning, a random amount of wisdom will be dealt between a min and max
- If retruning, there will be a 50% chance of losing all knowledge
- After the player learns or returns home the Guru sends chi back for a random hp amount
- The player and Guru will exchange energy each other in a loop until one of them passes out or deems success.
- If the player learns all from the guru you can give the Player some HP and special item that is stored in the inventory . After this, the player will continue walking.
- If the Guru deems the player not worthy the console prints a cool assuring message and the game ends -- "Sorry, you cannot continue this journey until the Guru's deem fit to bestow all wsisom upon you. Please return home and try again for the journy to enlightenment."
1. Inventory
- When the player is granted the Guru blessing, they are awarded with enlightenment (optional)
- If the user enters 'Print' or 'p' in the console, the console will print the players name, HP, and each item in their inventory

The story is the warroirs journey to enlightnment. Temptation along the way that takes vitality, If the player is successful to meet the Guru and earn the wisdom of the greatest teacher, then they will reach enlightenment. If giving into temptation and distraction, the player will need to return home for a nap.
